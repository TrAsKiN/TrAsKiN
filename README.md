Curious and passionate, I have been immersed in the world of web development for over 20 years. Self-taught by nature, I have built my skills through experimentation, practice, and continuous training, validated by certifications and diplomas. This approach has allowed me to master a wide range of web technologies, from front-end to back-end, including databases. My portfolio showcases my creativity and expertise through a variety of exciting projects. Always on the lookout for the latest innovations, I am enthusiastic about putting my skills to work on new challenges and contributing to ambitious projects.
